                    <p class="head">8. Bhujangasana (cobra pose)</p>
                    <p>
                        This pose is a part of the very beneficial surya namaskar. This pose stretches the neck and throat region, thereby increasing thyroid functioning. It is helpful for people suffering from hypothyroidism. People with back pain or neck pain should also do bhujangasana as it helps in strengthening and toning of muscles. Avoid this pose in case you have recently undergone an abdominal surgery or have hernia or ulcers.
